# M3U to HTML

This javascript function turns a m3u playlsit file into an html list. It simply parses the file, keeping only the file's name without the extension, without the absolute path and without the useless things you can find in a m3u. Check [this example](https://maxlefou.gitlab.io/m3u-to-html/) to see it in action.
